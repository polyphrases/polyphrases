# About Poly Phrases

This is an idea I had this morning, I wanted to play around with the OpenAI API to generate something.

So I thought about creating a script that sends me a phrase in different languages every day, but just three milliseconds after that, I thought... _"hey why not make it public so anyone can use it?"_.

It took me a couple of hours to put everything together, and here it is.

I modified this a bit to make it more user-friendly, and added a website to navigate through all past phrases, so you can practice your language skills whenever you want.

Also integrated the Elevenlabs API to add the pronunciation to all phrases. 

## Ideas for the future

Add some sort of UI to the website that lets you write the translation yourself and then use AI to give you a correction. So every day you can test your skills and get corrections by AI.
